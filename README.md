https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff167f51-eb34-4d45-b3df-7a9c0fa1fc9e

This project analyzes U.S. flight delay and cancellation data from 2019 to 2023 to evaluate airline and airport performance and uncover patterns in travel disruptions. The focus of the analysis is to identify trends in delays over time, the primary causes of delays and cancellations, and differences in on-time performance across various carriers and airports.

Using **Excel** features such as **ETL** with **Power Query**, data modeling with **Power Pivot**, and tools like **PivotTables** and **PivotCharts**, I created an interactive **dashboard**. This dashboard allows users to explore trends, compare performance, and identify actionable insights that can support data-driven operational improvements.

This project aims to enhance the *Health Bank One* mobile app for women aged 40-65 who manage chronic conditions. My team decided to expand existing features and add new ones, including a Health Dashboard, Daily Health Log, Lab Reports, Trend Analysis, and Medication Tracker. The goal is to enhance user engagement by transforming the app from a medical record consolidation tool into a comprehensive health management platform. I analyzed the survey data using **Microsoft Excel**, utilizing **pivot tables** and **Power Query** to organize the information. To visualize the results, I created bar and pie charts. Additionally, I worked on the **Medication Tracker** feature and developed a prototype for it using **Figma**.
