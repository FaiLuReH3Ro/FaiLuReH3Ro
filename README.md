This project aims to enhance the *Health Bank One* mobile app for women aged 40-65 who manage chronic conditions. My team decided to expand existing features and add new ones, including a Health Dashboard, Daily Health Log, Lab Reports, Trend Analysis, and Medication Tracker. The goal is to enhance user engagement by transforming the app from a medical record consolidation tool into a comprehensive health management platform. I analyzed the survey data using **Microsoft Excel**, utilizing **pivot tables** and **Power Query** to organize the information. To visualize the results, I created bar and pie charts. Additionally, I worked on the **Medication Tracker** feature and developed a prototype for it using **Figma**.
