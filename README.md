This project aims to enhance the *Health Bank One* mobile app for women aged 40-65 who manage chronic conditions. My team decided to expand existing features and add new ones, including a Health Dashboard, Daily Health Log, Lab Reports, Trend Analysis, and Medication Tracker. The goal is to enhance user engagement by transforming the app from a medical record consolidation tool into a comprehensive health management platform. I analyzed the survey data using **Microsoft Excel**, utilizing **pivot tables** and **Power Query** to organize the information. To visualize the results, I created bar and pie charts. Additionally, I worked on the **Medication Tracker** feature and developed a prototype for it using **Figma**.

The goal of this project is to design a mobile app for students at The University of Texas at Dallas that addresses procrastination and helps them complete their schoolwork. I researched academic procrastination by utilizing **UX research methods** to design wireframes for a mobile app that tackles this issue. My process included **secondary research**, **interviews**, and a **competitive analysis** to gather valuable insights. After completing my research, I compiled the findings into a detailed report that included an **empathy map**, a **design persona**, and a **future-state user journey**.
